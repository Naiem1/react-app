[] Make sure your app is responsive
[] The web app will have a header and a sub-header
[] There will be 5 components with each component with an icon roughly the same size as that in the first image. Each component will have a header and a description.You may take the icons from fontawesome
[] If the user hovers over the component header it will glow with the same color as the text.
[] Make sure that your code lets addition of new/extra components on the same page as easy as possible.
[] Place the components in such a way that none of them overlaps any of the vegetables in your background. Keep all of them on the black background.
